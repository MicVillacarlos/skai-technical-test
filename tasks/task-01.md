# Task 01: UI Pattern Matching

## Problem

You'll find an e-commerce landing page at `/tasks/task-01` with multiple sections already built. Your job is to build a custom section that matches the existing design patterns perfectly.

This tests your ability to:
- Recognize and replicate design patterns
- Maintain visual consistency across a codebase
- Work within an established design system

## Your Task

Build a **customer testimonials section** that matches the style, spacing, and patterns of the existing sections on the page.

### What to Do:

1. Visit `/tasks/task-01` and study all existing sections carefully
2. Open `/src/app/tasks/task-01/page.tsx` and find the "INSERT YOUR SECTION HERE" placeholder
3. Build a testimonials section featuring 3 customer reviews in a grid layout
4. Match the existing patterns for spacing, typography, borders, and interactions

### Content to Include:

Each testimonial should have:
- Customer quote (2-3 sentences about product quality, service, or experience)
- Customer name
- Optional: Location or role (e.g., "New York, NY" or "Verified Buyer")

Use placeholder content that feels authentic to an e-commerce context.

### What We're Looking For:

- **Visual Consistency**: Does it look like it belongs on the same page?
- **Pattern Recognition**: Did you identify and replicate the spacing, typography, and color patterns?
- **Attention to Detail**: Proper alignment, consistent borders, matching hover states
- **Responsive Design**: Works at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- **Layout Skills**: Appropriate grid structure that matches the page's design system

## Files to Work With

- `/src/app/tasks/task-01/page.tsx` - The landing page (replace the placeholder section)

## Time Estimate

20-30 minutes

## Tips

- Study the patterns first before coding
- Look at typography scales, spacing units, and color usage
- Check responsive breakpoints (how do sections change at `md:` and `lg:`?)
- Use the same components other sections use (Card, Button, etc.)
- Match the hover states and transitions

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

If you finish early or want to demonstrate additional skills:

- Add a success state that appears after subscribing
- Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Add subtle micro-interactions (hover effects, smooth transitions)
