# Task 02: Performance Audit

## Problem

You'll find a product gallery page at `/tasks/task-02` that has serious performance issues. This page was built quickly without optimization, and now it's slow, janky, and hurting conversion rates.

Your client (a D2C e-commerce brand) is complaining about:
- Slow page loads
- Poor Lighthouse scores
- High bounce rates on mobile
- Layout shifts during load

## Your Task

**Audit the page and identify performance issues** - you don't need to fix them, just document what's wrong and how you'd improve it.

### What to Do:

1. Visit `/tasks/task-02` and review the implementation in `/src/app/tasks/task-02/page.tsx`
2. Document your findings in this file (see template below)
3. For each issue, explain:
   - What's wrong
   - Why it's a problem
   - How you'd fix it (specific Next.js/React patterns)

### What We're Looking For:

- Deep understanding of Next.js optimization capabilities
- Knowledge of modern React performance patterns
- Awareness of Core Web Vitals and their impact on user experience
- Ability to articulate why performance matters for e-commerce

## File to Review

- `/src/app/tasks/task-02/page.tsx` - The slow product gallery page

## Time Estimate

15-20 minutes

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

If you finish early or want to demonstrate additional skills:

- Estimate the performance impact in metrics (e.g., "Could improve LCP by ~2s")
- Prioritize fixes by effort vs. impact (quick wins vs. major improvements)
- Suggest monitoring/testing strategies to catch these issues earlier in development

## Instructions

Document each performance issue you find in `/src/app/tasks/task-02/page.tsx`. For each issue:

1. **What's Wrong**: Describe the specific problem
2. **Why It Matters**: Explain the performance impact (metrics, UX, etc.)
3. **How to Fix**: Provide specific Next.js/React solution

Try to find **at least 8 issues**. Prioritize them by impact if you can.
